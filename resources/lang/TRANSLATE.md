# Translate EasyEdit

If you want to translate EasyEdit to your language, please follow the instructions below

### Updating an existing language
1. Fork the repository (Please use the "dev" branch)
2. Edit the translation in your preferred text editor (NOTE: Do not translate variables (e.g. `{expected}`))
3. Add yourself to the Author list & update the change date
4. Update the file if your repository & create a pull request

You can test your translation by using the "custom" language and editing "messages.yml"

### Creating a new language
Start with the [english translation](https://github.com/platz1de/EasyEdit/tree/dev/resources/lang/eng.yml) and update it accordingly<br>
The file should be named with a 3-letter identifier following ISO-639-3 ([lookup table](https://iso639-3.sil.org/code_tables/639/data?field_iso639_cd_st_mmbrshp_639_1_tid=94671))

If you don't want to create a pull request, you can paste your translation at websites like https://pastebin.com/ and create a new issue<br>
Thank you for your contribution!
